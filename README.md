# Overview
The documents in this repository specify Best Practices for
implementing Question/Test Interoperability (QTI) interaction types in
HTML 5. Accessibility requirements are met by appropriate use of HTML
and WAI-ARIA.

# Generating Documents from Source Files

The source files in this repository are written in markdown format
with extensions recognized by
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). A makefile is included.

Generated documents can be built by running `make` in the root directory of the
repository on a UNIX-like system with Pandoc installed. This creates output in
all of the formats currently supported by the makefile. Individual formats can
be generated by invoking special targets, e.g., `make html` to generate HTML
output only, or `make docx` to generate Office Open XML (OOXML) output for
Microsoft Word. You can also run `make clean` to delete generated files.

If [JSHint](http://jshint.com) is installed on your system and available in your shell's execution path, you can invoke `make check` to check all of the JavaScript code in the examples.
